This repository contains the source code for the TANDEM-DIMPLE project. 

Github repository: https://github.com/locitran/tandem.git. 

TANDEM-DIMPLE is a DNN model designed to predict the pathogenicity of missense variants. The model is trained on R20000 set obtained from the [Rhapsody](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/10/3084/5758260?login=true) study, using a wide range of features, including sequence&chemical, structural, and dynamics features.

**Comparison of prediction accuracy across general and disease-specific models.**
(A) Schematic overview of training and evaluation pipelines. 20,361 SAVs from Rhapsody (Ponzoni et al., 2020), referred to as R20000, were split into R20000<sub>train</sub>, R20000<sub>val</sub>, and R20000<sub>test</sub> in a 72:18:10 ratio. DNN-based general disease models (left) were trained on R20000<sub>train</sub> using either the TANDEM or Rhapsody feature sets. Model evaluation was conducted on R20000<sub>test</sub>, along with two additional SAV sets related to specific diseases: GJB2<sub>knw</sub> and RYR1<sub>knw</sub>. Subsequently, 30% of the SAVs from each set (GJB2<sub>train</sub>/RYR1<sub>train</sub>) were applied to fine-tune TANDEM models via transfer learning, while 10% (GJB2<sub>test</sub>/RYR1<sub>test</sub>) served in evaluating the specific disease models. (B-C) Comparison of prediction accuracy on independent test sets using general disease models and specific disease models.
